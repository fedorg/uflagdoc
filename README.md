#FAQ
## What is it?
UFlagDoc is a simple program to view Unreal Engine 4 internal UObject flags in human-readable form.
## Who needs this?
I don't know anyone but myself. Some folks that feel like debugging Unreal Engine may find use for it.
## How to use it?
I have included a win32 binary and a Visual Studio solution - if you are a happy Windows user, no building is required. You can probably build it for anything, though. (A bit too big of a binary for your '86 pocket calculator, but I'm working on it, trust me).
It is a really dumb interactive console application. There is no magic involved; you just type in Object Flags seen in Visual Studio and get the description of each flag set on that object. That's it.
## I want to sell it (and possibly kill people with it)
I don't care. Do whatever your dumb twisted mind tells you, but don't sue me pls.
